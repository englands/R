This repository contains all the work that I have done while learning the R language. I am currently learning it through ISM 5802: Information Analytics as part of my graduate program at the University of South Florida. I will also pursue the [Coursera Data Analytics in the Public Sector specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-analytics-in-the-public-sector-with-r?) offered by the University of Michigan.

For the course, the textbook being used is Data Mining for Business Analytics: Concepts, Techniques, and Applications in R by Galit Shmueli, et al.
